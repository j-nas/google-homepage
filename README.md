This project I will deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it.

The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.
This is the first time I've attempted HTML in this century.

===================
I arranged the elements using gridbox, I found that very intuitive.
I was struggling with the search bar border, and trying to change the color to light grey. The issue was border-type: inset;. Once I changed it to solid, it looked better.
Next todo is the hover settings for the search bar and buttons, then the nav bar and footer bar.
